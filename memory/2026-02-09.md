# 2026-02-09

- Ran local validation after recent UI and finance changes.
- `npm run build` succeeded.
- Fixed Vite CSS warning: moved Google Fonts `@import` statements above Tailwind directives in `src/index.css`.
- Updated `src/components/AppSidebar.tsx` to support icon-collapse behavior via shadcn `Sidebar`:
  - `collapsible="icon"` on `<Sidebar />`
  - Top toggle using `<SidebarTrigger />`
  - Default collapsed on desktop via `SidebarProvider defaultOpen={false}` in `src/components/AppLayout.tsx`
  - Collapsed mode hides labels/footer and centers icons; groups become transparent.
- Ledger: for `transfer` transactions, show responsible as `from - to` in `src/components/finances/LedgerView.tsx`.
- Copied updated favicons from `C:\Users\user\Desktop\RGT\favicon_io (2)` into `public/`.

- Added Salaries feature in Finances:
  - New `Salaries` tab (admin/worker/accountant) with monthly salary profiles (name, amount, due day).
  - Salary profiles stored on `owners` table via new columns `salary_amount` and `salary_due_day` (migration added).
  - Auto-generates current-month salary transactions in Ledger at month start (creates pending `category='salary'` transactions).

- Calendar page: added view controls and optional salary overlay:
  - View popover to filter calendar by hotels (`All`, `Owned`, `Other`) and toggle `check-ins only`.
  - Salary due markers and selected-day salary list (role-gated to admin/worker/accountant).

- UI polish pass across Finances, Ledger, Dashboard, and Admin Panel:
  - Rounded card shells, consistent teal accents, tightened spacing, clearer headers.
  - Replaced a garbled loading ellipsis string with ASCII `...` in Dashboard.
